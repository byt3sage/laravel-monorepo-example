# Laravel Monorepo Example
---
This is an example package to test the benefits of having multiple Laravel packages in a monorepo.
My inspiration for this comes from having a small development team with a lot of Laravel projects to keep
up-to-date.

## Note
You need to have the `php-intl` extension enabled for this to work.

This package uses symplify/monorepo-builder
